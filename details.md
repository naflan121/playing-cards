A) Programming Test
1. Theme: Playing cards will be given out to n(number) people
2. Purpose: Total 52 cards containing 1-13 of each Spade(S), Heart(H), Diamond(D), Club(C) will be
given to n people randomly.
3. Language to be used : PHP / Javascript / jQuery / ReactJS

* You can use any or combination of those languages. If you decide to use a combination
of languages, please provide in 2 types, front end & back end codes. (the more
combination of languages used, the higher the chances for you to be called in for the
interview)
* These codes will be tested in the platform mentioned in 7(b). And chrome browser will
be used as the testing browser.

4. Program file (source code) character code must be UTF-8 and line feed code must be LF.
5. Program Input :
a. Number of people (numerical value)
b. It does not matter how cards are given if recompile of program arguments, parameter,
keyboard input and so on are not necessary.
c. In case input value is nil or value is invalid then the error message of “Input value does
not exist or value is invalid” must be displayed and the process must be terminated.
d. Any number less than 0 is an invalid value.
e. Greater than 53 are normal values and cards must be distributed to a number of people
instead of having it as an error.

6. Output format :
a. Spade = S, Heart = H, Diamond = D, Club = C
b. Card 2 to 9 are, as it is, 1=A,10=X,11=J,12=Q,13=K
c. The card distributed to the first person on the first row will be separated (comma),
d. The card distributed to the second person on the second row will be separated(comma),
e. [LF] is not allowed. Example:
S-A,H-X,.....
D-3,H-J,.....

7. Remarks :
a. Please submit your work in Github repo.
b. The written code must comply with either:
i. Minimum supported environment PHP7, Node v12, React v16, MySQL v5.7
(depends on your chosen programming language); OR
ii. Create, build and run code within a virtual development environment using
Vagrant or Docker.

c. Please enter comments if you think it is necessary.
d. Please enter irregular processing to where there might be a possibility that an irregular
occurs.
e. Message “Irregularity occurred” must be displayed and the process must be terminated if
any irregular occurs.
f. All comments, usage manuals, and remarks must be explained in the source code.
g. Please create the above and reply to me with the total time you have spent on.
h. Reproduction / Reprint is prohibited.
